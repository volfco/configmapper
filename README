    configmapper.
    a simple program that can generate configuration files on demand based on a template.

    THIS IS A ALPHA PRODUCT. DO NOT EXPCT THE API TO REMAIN STABLE.

    background.
    the way I develop my rust programs is that they all accept a toml configuration file. moving these daemons into a
    containerized environment such as nomad or kubernetes presents the issue of needing to dynamically generate the
    configuration file from environmental variables as well as consul. nomad uses environmental variables such as
    NOMAD_ADDR_http and NOMAD_PORT_http to tell where the application to bind to. configmapper is a easy way to convert
    this dynamic data into a config file at runtime.

    supported data sources.
    - environmental variables.
      {{ENV|NOMAD_IP_http}} where ENV is the source, and NOMAD_IP_http is the environmental variable to look for
    - consul key value.
      {{CONSUL_KV|prod/nyc1/apps/megatron/db_uri}} where CONSUL_KV is the source, and prod/nyc1/apps... is the key to
      query consul for.

    more data sources are planned as I encounter the need for them. feel free to open up an issue to request other
    data sources.

    arguments.
    -i      input file.
    -o      output file.
